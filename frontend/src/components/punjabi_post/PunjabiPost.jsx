                            Punjabi is an Indo Ayran language which is the native language for millions of people and the tenth most spoken language in the world. Most of the Punjabi speakers are in the Punjab region in Pakistan and also India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The language developed from the ancient language known as Sanskrit and Punjabi is a tonal language that separates it from most.
                        </p>
                        <p className="m-0">
                            You will find when learning a new language if you keep thinking in your native language and then translate into the language you are learning this can be fine when you are by yourself but when you are trying to have a conversation at a fast pace with a native speaker you will have to start thinking in your new language.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div className="col-md-12 subhead p-0">
                        <h2>Punjabi comfort zone</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p className="mt-4">
                            Punjabi is one of those languages where you need to think in the native language to be successful at it in the long term. This is a very hard thing to do like a lot of people who speak several languages still think in there first language which is, of course, natural for all of us.
                        </p>
                        <p className="m-0">
                            Force yourself out of your comfort zone and immerse yourself in the Punjabi language and culture.
                        </p>

                        <p className="mt-4">
                            If you think in your native language and then try to speak Punjabi, you’ll always have to translate between languages. Translating is another thing which you can do when you are free you can do it in your free time. While speaking with a person it could be difficult for you. It’s completely fine when you give you when you speak with native speakers. Even people fluent in two or more languages have trouble switching between languages.
                        </p>
                        <p>When learning Punjabi speak to yourself and find someone to practice with. Make sure you focus on only Punjabi and not all of the mistakes you will make.</p>
                        <p>You will make many mistakes but you must keep positive and keep at it. The best way to speak Punjabi is to Listen a little. Speak a little. Read a little. Write a little. Then, listen a little more. Speak a little more. Read a little more. Write a little more. Do this, until it becomes your habit.</p>

                    <div className="col-md-12 subhead p-0">
                        <h2>Express the sounds</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p className="mt-4">
                            Punjabi uses a lot of stress in sentences and certain words. When you speak Punjabi you will have to make sure you emphasize these stress words because these sounds give the words different meanings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Social media is the ideal way to find groups and people to practice writing and talking to. You can help them learn English and they can help you learn Punjabi. Facebook, Instagram, and all social media platforms are perfect for this.
                        </p>
                        <p>Rest your brain once or twice a week so you can recharge your batteries and start again ready to go on Monday for example. The rest is just as important and studying. You have to be focused and alert when learning new languages.</p>
