                                To understand and appreciate the language better it is imperative to look deep into researching the Hindi culture. With the mesh of past cultures from all around the world influencing Hindiâ€™s identity,
                                it has changed and impacted how Hindi culture is seen in the 21st century.

                                Because of this influence, it is not uncommon to have some teachers and purists never use borrowed words as some believe a Hindi speaker should only use original Hindi words.
                                However, more commonly today you will find most teachers do not mind mixing it up and using the so-called borrowed words in the Hindi language of 2020.

                            You will find English words as well as Arabic words in the Hindi language. With trading for centuries between the Middle East and of course a big influence of the British,
                            this is another reason why the Hindi culture is so bright with diversity and a cultural melting pot linguistically.
